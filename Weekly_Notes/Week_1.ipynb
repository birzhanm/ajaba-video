Such systems should take a video as input and supply captions for the given video. \n","\n","##Project Motivation\n","A quick search would reveal that there are many such systems developed as a in academic papers, some of which are discussed below. So, one could ask why do we wish to reinvent the wheel by trying to build such a system from scratch. There are at least two reasons for this. Firstly, it is imperative to thoroughly understand such systems if we wish to adapt them for various applications such as violence detection and vision aids for blind people. One of the surest ways to gain such a thorough understanding of video captioning systems is to try to build such a system from scratch or replicate the existing systems. Secondly, there exists a possibility to extend capabilities of the current video captioning systems. \n","\n","##Existing Video Captioning Systems and Their Implementations\n","Below we present some of the video captioning systems already developed.

The images which constitute video are called frames. The number of frames in a given second of video is called *frames per second (fps)*. One of the basic ways of working with videos invlove splitting a video into frames, editing these frames and re-combining the frames into a resuting video. There are many tools and libraries fot for this kind of operations. We can choose a popular library called OpenCV, which stands for Open Computer Vision. Let us try to use this library to split a video into frames and then combining the frames to make a video.
